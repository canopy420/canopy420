## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Im Canopy.

## About Me
Hey! I'm Cano/Canopy, but I also go by "Kryx" or "Madrid." I'm a student from Spain interested in technology and computing in general. My favorite things in technology are Linux, networking, and AI. I think having your "own" system is something everyone should have. Networking i just like it, and I see AI as having a really great assistant that will even work for you! I'm also into hacking, and i have performed data breaches on some companies in Spain, but I can't say names ;p. I love social engineering, the fact that you can be whoever you want and trick people just fascinates me.

My main PUBLIC project right now is [Kuromi](https://github.com/canopy420/Kuromi-Multitool), a simple script to clean and manage your system.

i also love music, some of my favorite artist include, Playboi Carti, ISSBROKIE, Lil Peep and 6 dogs (RIP)

You can check my website at: https://canopy420.github.io/

i know that for now i don't do much, but this is just the start for my world domination plan.
